        ORIGINS
        <br><br>
        Chinese music has thousands or years of history. In early dynasties, 
        it was only enjoyed by the royal families. During the Tang Dynasty, 
        dancing and singing entered the mainstream, in part with the help of 
        religion such as Buddhism. 
        
        <br><br> During the Yuan Dynasty (1279â€“1368) many traditional instruments 
        were developed and following soon after in the Ming (1368 - 1644) 
        and Qing Dynasties (1644 - 1911), the art of traditional opera developed.

            OPERA
            <br><br>
            Chinese opera is one of the oldest dramatic art forms in the world. 
            One of the most notable features of the opera is the costume consisting of 
            facial makeup done to exaggerate a person's character and an elaborate
            robe of different colors which represent different characteristics. 
            <br><br>

            In terms of music, Chinese opera uses a mix of dialogue, singing, and 
            a small orchestra to supplement the play. Opera singers typically sing in 
            a high pitch with a lot of vibrato. They also must sing without moving their 
            mouths much. The content often features action and romance through martial arts and acting, but 
            often also was an outlet for political commentary prior to the cultural revolution.

            CULTURAL REVOLUTION
            <br><br>
            The Cultural Revolution was the communist regime's attempt to destroy
             "old ways of thinking" by outlawing traditions including traditional music and art. 
             An attack on one Beijing opera piece and its composer signaled the start of the Cultural Revolution.

            <br><br>
            In 1960, Chairman Mao, the leader of communist China, 
            commissioned a professor to write an opera about a minister of the Ming Dynasty who was fired for criticizing the Emperor
             to his face. Audiences saw the play as a critique of the Emperor and thus Mao. 
              In reaction, Mao fired the composer and opera troupes were disbanded and performances were banned until Mao's death in 1976.
              This did not only effect opera but all traditional art forms in China.
