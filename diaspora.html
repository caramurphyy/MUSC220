        Chinese Americans currently makeup the 3rd largest origin group in the United States. 
        It is the largest destination for Chinese immigrants worldwide, however, immigration hasn't always been 
        easy for them. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act was passed by Congress in 
        response to anti-Chinese sentiment and emigration controls imposed by the 
        Chinese Communist Revolution limited most immigration until the 1965 
        removal of barriers for non-European immigrants to the United States 
        and end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s. 

        <br><br>

        The first small wave of Chinese immigration occured in the 1860s as Chinese labor
        was used to build the transcontinental railroad but was severely halted by the Chinese Exclusion Act.
        In recent years, the reason for immigrating for many Chinese has been for education or skilled work.

            Following the ban of traditional art forms during the cultural revolution, 
            the practice of the art forms was largely lost and still suffers from restrictions 
            after the ban was lifted. Artists in China who compose anything that paints 
            the party in a bad way or even references historical events can be targeted. 
            As a result, the practice of many traditional art forms has been taken on by Chinese in diaspora.
            One of the most well-known examples in the US is Shen Yun, a performance group that tours worldwide 
            showcasing traditional Chinese dance, stories, and music. Hundreds of performers reenact stories 
            in elaborate costumes to a live orchestra.
