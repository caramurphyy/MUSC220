        Chinese Americans currently makeup the 3rd largest origin group in the United States. 
        It is the most popular destination for Chinese immigrants worldwide, however, immigration hasn't always been 
        easy for them. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act was passed by Congress in 
        response to anti-Chinese sentiment and emigration controls imposed by the 
        Chinese Communist Revolution limited most immigration until the 1965 
        removal of barriers for non-European immigrants to the United States 
        and end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s. 

        <br><br>

        The first small wave of Chinese immigration occured in the 1860s as Chinese labor
        was used to build the transcontinental railroad but was severely halted by the Chinese Exclusion Act.
        In recent years, the reason for immigrating for many Chinese has been for education or skilled work.

            Following the ban of traditional art forms during the cultural revolution, 
            the practice of the art forms was largely lost and still suffers from restrictions 
            after the ban was lifted. Artists in China who compose anything that paints 
            the party in a bad way or even references historical events can be targeted. 
            As a result, the practice of many traditional art forms has been taken on by Chinese in diaspora.
            One of the most well-known examples in the US is Shen Yun, a performance group that tours worldwide 
            showcasing traditional Chinese dance, stories, and music. Hundreds of performers reenact stories 
            in elaborate costumes to a live orchestra.
            <br><br>
            Millions of americans have seen the show and been exposed to traditional Chinese dance and music.

            There are many kinds of traditional dance still practiced in China, but even more in diaspora. 
            One such popular dance is the Lion Dance which is performed during major holidays like Chinese 
            New Year. A group of performers don a large lion costume and dance to the beat of Chinese drums, 
            cymbals, and gongs. It is a upbeat dance done to bring good fortune.

            Other forms of dance include ribbon dancing, a dance that has been aorund for over 1000 years. 
            For this dance, dancers wear robes with long sleeves that
            flow with their movements. It is also performed to the beat of a Chinese drum and gong. Dancers often 
            try to mimic things in natura such as water or air with this dance.
